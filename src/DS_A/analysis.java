--In asymptotic analysis we measure the order of growth.
--in the analysis we always consider that the time taken and input size is >0, so the graph is in 1st quadrant.
Asymptotic notation  -- used to represent the order of growth of algorithm
**Big O- Represents exact bound or upper bound
**Theta - Represents exact bound
**Omega - Represents exact bound or lower bound
