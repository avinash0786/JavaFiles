Note: There are many available classes in the Java API that can be used to read and write files in Java:
FileReader, BufferedReader, Files, Scanner, FileInputStream, FileWriter, BufferedWriter, FileOutputStream, etc.
Which one to use depends on the Java version you're working with and whether you need to read bytes or characters,
and the size of the file/lines etc.
